# Accelerating Sorting in Graph Processing Adjacency Lists

The project was completed as part of ECE 506 (Architecture of Parallel Computers) at NC State. In this project, I parallelized the pre-processing step of a graph processing program in C++. Utilizing Radix sort, an OpenMP, MPI, and Hybrid version was developed to test my understanding of various concepts in shared memory parallelism,
message passing, and others.
